# Arduino-Starfield

Version: 1.0.0  
Author: [Jordan Mack](http://jmack.parhelic.com)

A very simple side scrolling star field simulation that runs on the Arduino UNO using a generic 2.4" TFT LCD. This is a good project to look at if you're a beginner, and want a simple demonstration to mess around with.

## Notes
 * This was created and tested on an Arduino UNO, but should work fine with other Arduino boards as well.
 * I used very cheap brandless 2.4" TFT LCD shield purchased from China. It should work fine with other screens, but will require some modifications to select the correct driver for your screen.
 * I don't bother with any of the screen detection code since my screen returns an unknown code.
